# DeZog Unit tests

Example trying to use DeZog Unit tests. The goal is to create two NEX files, one for the main game, the second for the tests.

There's two NEX files that can be built:
    - dzut.nex -> the main "game"
    - dzut_tests.nex -> the unit tests

## Issue

When you build both, the tests show up in the test explorer but when you run them, the error "Code for tests it not present" is shown.
